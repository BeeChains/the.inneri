# ["God dwells in you, as you, and you don't have to 'do' anything to be God-realized or Self-realized, it is already your true and natural state." Just drop all seeking, turn your attention inward, and sacrifice your mind to the One Self radiating in the Heart of your very being. For this to be your own presently lived experience, Self-Inquiry is the one direct and immediate way."](https://peacefulrivers.homestead.com/Maharshi.html#:~:text="God%20dwells%20in%20you%2C%20as,Heart%20of%20your%20very%20being.&text=in%20quest%20of%20the%20Self%20is%20the%20best%20means) Sri Ramana Maharshi
