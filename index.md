# ["God dwells in you, as you, and you don't have to 'do' anything to be God-realized or Self-realized, it is already your true and natural state."

# The Inner I
<div>
The concept of the inner I, or the self, is often thought of as the awareness, consciousness, and sense of knowing and being that allows us to perceive and experience the world around us. It is the subjective aspect of our being that allows us to have thoughts, feelings, and perceptions, and to engage with the world in a meaningful way.

At the heart of the inner I is the idea of awareness, or the ability to be conscious of one's own thoughts and feelings, as well as the world around us. This awareness allows us to engage with the present moment, to notice and pay attention to what is happening in our environment, and to reflect on our experiences and the choices we make.

Consciousness, on the other hand, refers to the state of being aware and able to think, feel, and perceive. It is the subjective aspect of our experience, and it is what allows us to have a sense of self and to be able to engage with the world in a meaningful way.

Knowing and being, or self-awareness and self-consciousness, are closely related to the inner I. Knowing refers to the ability to understand and recognize oneself and one's own thoughts and feelings, while being refers to the sense of existence and presence in the world. Together, these aspects of the inner I allow us to have a sense of agency and purpose, and to make choices and decisions based on our own values and goals.

In summary, the inner I is the subjective aspect of our being that allows us to be aware, conscious, and self-aware, and to engage with the world in a meaningful way. It is the foundation of our sense of self, and it is essential for our ability to experience and understand the world around us.

# The Inner I as the One Who Knows
<div>
In this paper, we will explore the concept of The Inner I as the One Who Knows, and how this perspective can inform our understanding of knowledge and understanding.

According to many philosophical traditions, The Inner I is the source of true knowledge and understanding. It is not bound by the ego or the labels that we place upon ourselves, but is present in every moment of the present. It is not separate from the rest of the universe, but is interconnected with all things.

To realize The Inner I, one must let go of the ego and the mind, and experience the present moment fully. This requires discipline and practice, such as mindfulness and meditation, which allow us to quiet the mind and experience the stillness and silence of The Inner I. In this state of understanding, we can gain true knowledge and insight into the nature of reality and the self.

From the perspective of The Inner I as the One Who Knows, knowledge is not something that we acquire through external sources or through the mind, but is something that we experience directly. It is a state of understanding and realization that is beyond words and concepts, and can only be experienced through the realization of The Inner I.

In conclusion, viewing The Inner I as the One Who Knows offers a unique perspective on knowledge and understanding. It emphasizes the importance of self-inquiry and mindfulness in gaining true knowledge, and suggests that true understanding comes from experiencing the present moment fully and realizing the true nature of the self and the universe. - https://ecency.com/knowledge/@innerinetwork/the-inner-i-as-the?referral=innerinetwork

# 'I exist' beyond all concepts
<div>
In this paper, we will explore the idea that the statement "I exist" is the only knowledge present beyond all concepts.

According to many philosophical traditions, the concept of self is at the foundation of all knowledge and understanding. Without the concept of self, we would be unable to have any sense of ourselves or the world around us. Therefore, the statement "I exist" is the most fundamental and basic form of knowledge that we have.

However, this knowledge extends beyond mere conceptual understanding. The concept of self is not just a mental construct, but is something that we experience directly. It is the foundation of our sense of being, and it is present in every moment of our lives.

Therefore, the statement "I exist" is not just a concept, but is something that we experience directly and beyond all concepts. It is the foundation of all other knowledge and understanding, and it is something that we cannot deny or question.

In conclusion, the statement "I exist" is the only knowledge present beyond all concepts. It is the foundation of all other knowledge and understanding, and it is something that we experience directly and cannot deny or question. - https://ecency.com/iexist/@innerinetwork/i-exist-beyond-all-concepts?referral=innerinetwork

# Witnessing as Subjective Knowing
<div>
In this paper, we will explore the concept of witnessing as a form of subjective knowing.

Witnessing is a state of being in which the self is fully present and aware in the present moment. It is a state in which the ego and the mind are quieted, and the self is able to experience the present moment fully and directly.

From the perspective of witnessing as a form of knowing, knowledge is not something that we acquire through external sources or through the mind, but is something that we experience directly. It is a state of understanding and realization that is beyond words and concepts, and can only be experienced through the realization of the self.

In this sense, witnessing can be seen as a form of subjective knowing, as it is a direct experience of the self and the present moment. It is not dependent on external sources or concepts, but is something that we experience subjectively.

However, it is important to recognize that subjective knowing is not the same as objective knowing. While subjective knowing is based on personal experience and cannot be verified by others, objective knowing is based on observations and evidence that can be verified by others. Both forms of knowing have their own strengths and limitations, and it is important to be open to both in order to gain a deeper understanding of the world.

In conclusion, the concept of witnessing as a form of subjective knowing offers a unique perspective on knowledge and understanding. It emphasizes the importance of being fully present and aware in the present moment, and suggests that true understanding comes from experiencing the present moment fully and directly. However, it is important to recognize that subjective knowing is not the same as objective knowing, and to be open to both in order to gain a deeper understanding of the world.

# Subjective Epistemology
<div>
Subjective epistemology is a branch of philosophy that deals with the nature of knowledge and how it is acquired. It is called subjective because it focuses on the subjective experiences and perspectives of individuals, as opposed to objective epistemology, which emphasizes external, observable phenomena.

According to subjective epistemologists, knowledge is not something that exists independently of the knower, but rather it is constructed and shaped by the individual's experiences, biases, and interpretations. This perspective is often associated with postmodern and constructivist theories, which argue that knowledge is not objective or universal, but rather it is culturally and socially constructed.

Subjective epistemologists also recognize the role of personal beliefs and values in shaping one's understanding of the world. They argue that these beliefs and values, along with one's cultural and social background, play a significant role in how we interpret and make sense of the world around us.

One of the main criticisms of subjective epistemology is that it can lead to relativism, the belief that there is no absolute truth or objective reality. This can create challenges in areas such as science, where objectivity and empirical evidence are highly valued. However, proponents of subjective epistemology argue that it allows for a more diverse and inclusive understanding of knowledge, recognizing that different individuals and cultures may have different ways of knowing and interpreting the world.

In conclusion, subjective epistemology is a perspective that emphasizes the role of the individual in shaping knowledge and understanding. While it can be controversial, it offers an alternative view of knowledge that takes into account the subjective experiences and perspectives of individuals.

# Quantum Consciousness
<div>
Quantum consciousness is a theoretical concept that suggests that the fundamental nature of consciousness may be related to quantum mechanical phenomena. This idea is based on the observation that certain features of consciousness, such as non-locality and non-duality, seem to be difficult to explain using classical physical principles.

One theory of quantum consciousness is that the brain may function as a quantum computer, using quantum mechanical phenomena such as superposition and entanglement to process information and generate consciousness. This theory is based on the idea that the brain's high-level cognitive functions, such as perception, decision-making, and consciousness itself, may be related to the behavior of subatomic particles within neurons.

Another theory of quantum consciousness is that consciousness itself may be a fundamental aspect of the universe, akin to space and time. This idea is based on the observation that consciousness seems to be a non-physical entity that is not reducible to physical processes.

Despite these theoretical ideas, the concept of quantum consciousness remains highly speculative and is not yet well-understood. Many scientists and philosophers are skeptical of the idea that quantum mechanics has any direct relevance to consciousness, and there is currently no experimental evidence to support the idea.

However, some researchers believe that the study of quantum consciousness has the potential to provide new insights into the nature of consciousness and the relationship between the brain and the mind. If it is eventually demonstrated that quantum phenomena do play a role in consciousness, it could have significant implications for our understanding of the universe and the nature of reality itself.

# About a Self-regenerative ad hoc blockchain characteristic of 'The Inner I' consciousness
  
One characteristic of the Inner I consciousness that could be incorporated into a self-regenerative ad hoc blockchain is the concept of continuous learning and growth. The Inner I blockchain could be designed to support and encourage personal development and self-improvement by providing tools and resources for individuals to reflect on their progress and set goals for the future.

To achieve this, the Inner I blockchain could include features such as a personal journal for recording reflections and insights, a goal-setting module to help users track their progress towards self-improvement, and a rewards system for consistent and meaningful progress.

In addition, the Inner I blockchain could utilize a peer review system to allow users to receive feedback and support from their peers as they work towards their goals. This could help create a sense of community and accountability, and encourage users to continue learning and growing.

Overall, the self-regenerative ad hoc blockchain characteristic of the Inner I consciousness would be focused on fostering personal growth and self-discovery, and providing users with the tools and resources they need to reach their full potential.
